Given	I'm logged-in with valid credentials
And	I'm on Page 05 of Feet MRI
and I select 'Finding' radio button
And I select 'Ligamenta' from the dropdown menu

When I click on the dropdown menu again
And I select 'Delete entry' from the dropdown menu
Then 'Ligamenta' selection is cleared
And 'Add new finding' button is disabled
