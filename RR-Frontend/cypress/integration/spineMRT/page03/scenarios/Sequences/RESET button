Given	I'm logged-in with valid credentials
And	I'm on Page 03 of Spine MRI
And I select the radio button "Individual" in Sequences box
And	I select any weighting from "Weighting" dropdown menu

When I click on 'RESET' button
Then a dialogue window pops up with 2 buttons (Cancel & OK)
When I click on 'OK' button
Then any weightings previously selected from 'Weighting' dropdown menu is being reset and cleared
