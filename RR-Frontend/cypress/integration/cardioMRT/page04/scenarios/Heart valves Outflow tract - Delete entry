//Heart valves/Outflow tract - Delete entry


Given	I'm logged-in with valid credentials
And	I'm on Page 04 of Cardio MRI
And I select 'Finding' radio button
And I select 'Heart valves/Outflow tract' tab

When I select 'Tricuspid valve' from 'Heart valves' dropdown menu
Then 'Add pathology' button is enabled
And 'Stenosis' checkbox is enabled
And 'Insufficiency' checkbox is enabled
And 'Calcification' checkbox is enabled

When I select 'Delete entry' from 'Heart valves' dropdown menu
Then 'Tricuspid valve' is deselected
And 'Heart valves' dropdown menu is blank
And 'Add pathology' button is disabled
