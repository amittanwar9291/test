//Previous interventions / therapies - Add new finding



Given	I'm logged-in with valid credentials
And	I'm on Page 02 of Mammography/Breast ultrasound
And 'Yes' radio button is selected
And 'Breast augmentation' is selected from the dropdown
When I click on 'Add new finding'
Then a second dropdown menu is enabled
And 'Add new finding' is disabled
