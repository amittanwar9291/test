Given	I'm logged-in with valid credentials
And	I'm on Page 07 of Hip MRI
And I select 'Finding' radio button
And I select 'Bursitis' from the dropdown menu

When I click on Finding dropdown menu
And I select 'Delete entry'
Then dropdown menu selection is cleared to 'Please select' 
And 'Add new finding' button is disabled
