//Age function

Given	I'm logged-in with valid credentials
And patient's birthDate is logged in
When I'm go to Page 01 of Mamma MRI
Then Age = todaysDate - birthDate in years
When	I move the 'Weight / Mass' slidebar to 080 kg
And	I move the 'Height' sliderbar to 180 cm
Then 'BMI' is 24,7 BMI
And	'BMI class' is 'NORMAL WEIGHT'
When I select the radio button 'Female'
And I refresh the webpage
Then all data is autosaved.
